# My name is Payton Taylor

## About Me
- I am a 26 year old from Alabama who enjoys technology as a whole and trying to find my niche to advance my career in. I have past experience as a Help Desk Technician, NOC Technician, and Cyber Security Analyst. I love having the ability to add a creative element to any work I do and have found that web development allows me the ability to bring out more of my creative side into my everyday life unlike past job experiences. I hope to help companies bring solutions to their products and advance in different avenues. I enjoy working with a team as a lover of sports such as football and baseball throughout my childhood up until college I have always loved the comradery and ability to grow as a whole to pursue a bigger end goal that would be impossible as an individual.

- I started my journey into coding as a complete beginner in September of 2022 and have loved the process of seeing my approach to problem solving and learning grow exponentially ever since. I cannot wait to join a team of bright individuals that help me grow even more... I have a long way to go on my journey but loving every second of it.
